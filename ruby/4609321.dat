II fo. 122 (the 2nd leaf of quire 13), with text of the last verses of Ezekiel 33, all of Ezekiel 34, and beginning verses of Ezekiel 35. The leaf comes from an otherwise lost copy of the Gutenberg Bible. It is one of nineteen such leaves, all belonging to quires 13 and 14 of volume II, that were cut down to a smaller size and pasted together to create pasteboard for some unidentified bookbinding, probably in the sixteenth century. About a dozen copies of the Gutenberg Bible, most of which were printed on vellum, are known only from fragmentary preservation as bookbinding materials. These cut-down paper leaves came to light when the Vienna bookdealers Gilhofer & Ranschburg offered them leaf by leaf in an auction of 3 April 1911. Two other leaves from this group are at the Library of Congress, a third is at Dartmouth College Library, and a fourth is at the State Library of New South Wales in Sydney. The rubrication of the copy is simple, using only red ink.xNjP  aAlso available in an electronic version.  aWHS copy is one of three copies bound in the workshop of Johannes Fogel of Erfurt.5NjP  xmlc1 aGutenberg, Johann,d1397?-1468,eprinter.0http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n500349161 aFogel, Johannes,dactive 1455-1462,ebinder.5NjP.0http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nr000053781 aBrinley, George,d1817-1875,eformer owner.5NjP0http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nr970377191 aIves, Brayton,d1840-1914,eformer owner.5NjP0http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n840018241 aCole, Hamilton,eformer owner.5NjP1 aEllsworth, James W.q(James William),d1849-1925eformer owner.5NjP0http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nr920196682 aPredigerkirche (Erfurt, Germany),eformer owner.5NjP0http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nr200402089841uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/7d278t10z41zCuratorial documentationuhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3HwfRG3YqiNVVR4bXNvRzNwaGs  amrfbo6a7mdvf1e200510278 04847980bwhst1h48.1xFormer call number: S4.2 004847980avol.1-28 04848993bwhst2h113.2xFormer call number: 3.3.1 004848993afragment (one leaf from Ezekiel 34) 004848993zPrinceton copy 28 010782671belf1hElectronic Resource  a2005-10-27 09:59:19 -0400
