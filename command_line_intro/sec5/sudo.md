## sudo: Execute a command as another user

`sudo` allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified in the sudoers file.  By default, sudo requires that users authenticate themselves with a password (NOTE: by default this is the userâ€™s password, not the root password).

### /etc/sudoers

This file controls who can use the sudo command to gain elevated privileges. It is usually located at /etc/sudoers. The best and safest way to edit this file is by using the `visudo` command. This command will start the OS's default editor with elevated privileges so that you can edit the file and save it. It also will put a filelock on the sudoers file so that no one else can edit it. Once your done editing it, it will parse the file for simple errors.

On the virtual machine your instructor gave the user `yournetid` all rights. We will look at that shortly.

```bash
yournetid@ruby-office1:~$ sudo --help
yournetid@ruby-office1:~$ sudo -l
yournetid@ruby-office1:~$ visudo
```
